# For_LRE_Map_corpus
This repository is for LRE Map. 

We used the data which is WIT3, OPUS, Production corpus, synthetic corpus in the paper. 

We upload our synthetic source Korean-Arabic bilingual corpus.
We can share this corpus.

But other corpus like the WIT3, OPUS, synthetic target and Production corpus can't be shared in LRE map.

The WIT3 and OPUS corpus is open-source corpus. Then anyone can get this data from each site.
And the production corpus built by paying money can't be shared.
Because a Korean of the synthetic target Korean-Arabic is based on the production corpus, we can't share this corpus.

If you have any questions, please email choko93@ust.ac.kr.
